# Data Structures Course Codebase

This repository contains all the code, assignments, and projects developed during my Data Structures course. It covers a wide range of fundamental data structures and algorithms, implemented in C++.

## Project Structure

- **Array/**: Programs and utilities for array manipulation, searching, and pattern problems.
- **SinglyLinkList/**: Implementations and problems related to singly linked lists.
- **DoublyLinkList/**: Doubly linked list implementations and related problems.
- **Queue/**: Queue implementations (array, linked list, circular, deque, priority queue) and queue-based problems.
- **Stack/**: Stack implementations (array, linked list, STL) and stack-based problems.
- **Heap/**: Max heap, min heap, heap sort, and related heap problems.
- **Trees/**: Binary search trees, traversals, BST problems, and tree utilities.
- **avl_trees/**: AVL tree implementations and balancing algorithms.
- **HashTables/**: Hash table implementations and related problems.
- **Sorting/**: Sorting algorithms (quick sort, merge sort, insertion, selection, bubble, heap sort).
- **Searching/**: Searching algorithms (binary search, linear search, etc.).
- **recursion/**: Recursive function examples and problems.
- **strings/**: String manipulation and pointer-based string operations.
- **pointers/**: Pointer basics and pointer-based problems.
- **LinearList/**: Linear list implementations and vector usage.
- **Implementation/**: Additional list implementations and STL list usage.
- **Problems/**: Miscellaneous coding problems and small projects (e.g., tic-tac-toe).
- **lab_project/**: Larger lab projects and assignments.
- **DataStructure assginment 3/**: Major assignments, including code and reports.
- **DS_lab/**: Lab submissions and zipped files.
- **c++/**: General C++ utilities and input validation.

## How to Use

- All code is written in C++ and can be compiled with any standard C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++, MSVC).
- Each directory contains self-contained programs or modules. Refer to the file names for specific data structures or problems.
- Some directories contain `.exe` files (Windows executables) for quick testing.
- For assignments and lab projects, refer to the respective folders for code and documentation.

## Notes

- This codebase is a learning resource and may contain experimental or draft code.
- Code is not uniformly documented; refer to file and function names for guidance.
- No code has been modified for documentation purposesâ€”this README is for navigation and understanding only.
